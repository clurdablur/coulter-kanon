				<h3>Riley Bourgault</h3>
				<h5>Maid of Honor</h5>
				<p>It all started in third grade. When I first met Riley, I thought she was weird. One day her (intimidating at the time) dad visited her at lunch and insisted that we be friends. I was so scared that I decided to give our friendship a try. Let's just say we became sisters. We lived on the same street and practically grew up living together. We spent countless days cruising on the golf cart, playing club penguin and roller coaster tycoon, and jamming out to music in her 1965 mustang that would randomly break down on the street while she reassured me that it happens and we would be okay. I am so glad her father forced me to be her friend!</p>

				<h3>Chelsea Gonzales</h3>
				<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
				<p>Chelsea and I became friends during our first semester at Texas A&amp;M in Accounting 327. On the first day of class, we sat on the same row with a guy that was sitting between us. One day, he randomly caught a nasty fly with his bare hands. Shocked and kind of grossed out, Chelsea and I made eye contact and became the best of friends from that day forward. We pulled many all-nighters studying for accounting and supply chain, studied abroad together and got lost in a foreign country and laughed until we found our way back to the hotel, and accomplished school work with our endless supply of sour skittles (a must). I could not have done college without her!</p>

				<h3>Claire Coulter</h3>
				<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
				<p>Claire is Andrew's twin sister. After knowing Andrew for less than one week, Andrew insisted that I add Claire on Facebook. I thought it would be strange to add her since I had never met her. Andrew being Andrew, he called her on the phone when we were driving and put her on speaker phone. After what seemed like a long conversation, she found out that I was listening. Let's just say it was awkward since she had no idea of my presence. That day we became Facebook friends. I got to meet her officially when we went to Dallas for a friend’s wedding. I am so excited to gain a sister-in-law!! I look forward to the many memories that we will create together!!</p>

				<h3>Athena Krideras</h3>
				<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
				<p>I met Athena while working at H-E-B in the pharmacy. She easily became a great friend of mine. She lived across the railroad tracks from me and soon made her home in my house. During my senior year of college, Athena and I would spend our week days cooking, watching movies (more like her watching movies and me talking to Andrew on the phone), and/or eating something sugary/fattening. Some of my favorite memories consist of our Marble Slab dates and cruising around College Station with the windows down, blaring music like “I like Tuh” and “$ave Dat Money” as I hid in the floorboard at red lights because I was so embarrassed as people stared. I facetime her almost every day and I am so thankful for the friendship that we have!</p>

				<h3>Courtney Perkins</h3>
				<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
				<p>Courtney and I met in Business Law; however, our friendship blossomed in the summer of 2015 during ISYS 210 at Texas A&amp;M. Courtney was the first friend I made in college. She introduced me to my first alcoholic beverage (Jack Daniel’s Downhome Punch) and the party scene. She was determined to show me the true college life. We have made many memories throughout college that can’t be shared to the public (LOL). She taught me a lot about the traditions at A&amp;M and was the first person who introduced me to Aggie Football. To this day, I cherish all the memories we had and will have in the future!</p>

				<h3>Joseph Lewman</h3>
				<h5>Best Man</h5>
				<p>From Mrs. Winkler's kindergarten class, to an undefeated soccer team in 4th grade, to band trips and solo competitions during high school, Joey and Andrew have been through it all. After 20 years of friendship, you can always find them hanging out drinking margaritas at Lopez, floating down the San Marcos River, or shooting at the range.</p>

				<h3>Andrew Gauthier</h3>
				<h5>Groomsman</h5>
				<p>When Drew first got to Fort Hood, he was just another butter bar. But soon after a trip to Austin together, the two quickly became friends, and eventually roommates. The Swamp is their bachelor pad, full of game of thrones banners, a beer wall, and their mascot Andygator.</p>

				<h3>Gavin Chase</h3>
				<h5>Groomsman</h5>
				<p>Andrew first met Gavin when they became plebe year roommates at West Point. Throughout their time, they spent countless hours discussing religion, politics, and much more. Inscribed on the back of both of their class rings are the letters VDMA, which stand for Verbum Domini Manet in Aeternum, or The Word of the Lord Endures Forever.</p>

				<h3>Vinny Kennedy</h3>
				<h5>Groomsman</h5>
				<p>Andrew and Vinny were in the same plebe year company at West Point (A3), but they really became friends during the Engineer Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, following their graduation from USMA. They were constantly hanging out during and outside of classes, watching football, working out, or exploring all that the middle-of-nowhere Missouri had to offer (not much). Whenever they needed a break, they would relax by having a snickers and beer (usually a Wisconsin Spotted Cow or a Guinness).</p>

				<p>Zach and Andrew first became friends during the West Point Pipes and Drums trip to the Royal Military College in Canada during their plebe year. From then on, you could always find them together on band trips or hanging out at the firstie club. Now they are both stationed at Fort Hood and sometimes hang out when Zach isn't in Korea or at the National Training Center.</p>

				<h3>Devin Croney</h3>
				<h5>Groomsman</h5>
				<p>Andrew first met Devin at 2am during Zero Day of Air Assault School. They quickly became close as they did countless push ups basically on top of each other. Later on, Andrew helped Devin create the unofficial position of Band Manager, allowing them to hang out during every band trip while Devin had someone else take pictures. They were always hanging out with Zach and most of their weekends started with a meeting at Devin's 'office.'</p>
